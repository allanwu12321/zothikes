ZotHikes is a recommendation app that suggests nearby outdoor activities to users (mostly hiking trails)
based on their physical characteristics, location, goals and activity levels.

As of now the app takes a user's physical characteristics as input and stores them.
It asks for location permissions and if allowed, displays a map with the user's location.

Future implementations:
-menu option to edit/update physical characteristics/goals
-activity log
